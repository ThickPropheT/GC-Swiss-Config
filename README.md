Hiding Files in Swiss Menu:
--------------------------

Files that are necessary for system functionality but are not useful for end-use
can be hidden from view in Swiss's menus to avoid clutter or accidental execution
of apps that shouldn't be run by end-users (e.g. `boot.iso` or `autoexec.dol`).

1. Navigate to the file you wish to hide in Swiss.
1. Right click the file and select `Properties`.
1. In the `Attributes:` section, check the box next to `Hidden`.
